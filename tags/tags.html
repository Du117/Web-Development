        <h1>This is a Demonstration of <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags.</h1>
        <p>This is the <dfn>paragraph tag</dfn>. This tag would contain paragraphs containing information that are essential for the webpage.</p>
        <h2>Demonstration of the tags br and hr.</h2>
        <p>under normal circumstances the browser would collapse all extra whitespaces in between the <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">
        HTML</abbr> code. To overcome this we use the breakline tag. I am using a breakline tag here to demonstrate its use.<br />See how the
        content of restarts from the next line. The following line demostrate the use of the hr tag. <hr />See how there exists a horizontal
        line in between the above sentence and this one.</p>
        <div>
            <p>This is a different division inside the HTML Body. The following is a demonstration of the "pre" tag.
            <hr />
            <pre>
                This is an example of the "pre" tag. It displays the content on the browser as it is written in the HTML Script.
                For instance how this sentence starts on a new line as is written in the HTML script.            And the amount of space left
                before this one.
            </pre><hr /></p>
        </div>
        <br /><br />
        <hr />
        <div>          <!--Demonstration of Text markuop tags : strong, b, em, i, code, del, sub, sup.-->
            <h2>Text Markup Tags - strong, b, em, i, code, del, sub and sup tags</h2>
            <p>This is the demonstration of the <strong>strong tag</strong>. This a demonstration of the "b" tag which is used to <b>make the
            contents within the tags bold.</b><br />
            <em>This is an example of the use of the "em" tag.</em> The italics tag "i" converts the contents of the paragraph within the
            <i>italics tag to italics</i>.<br/>
            The quotation tag denoted by 'q' <q>defines a short quotation. Browsers normally insert the quotation marks around the end of the
            quotations.</q><br /><br />
            The following is a demonstration of the "code" tag, which is used for displaying programming language codes in an HTML page.
            <code>
                <pre>
                #include[iostream.h]
                #inlcude[conio.h]
                using namespace std ;
                int main()
                {
                    printf("Hello World !!!")
                    return 0 ;
                }</pre>
            </code>
            This is a demonstration of the <del>deleted</del> tag.<br />
            The following is a demonstration of the <sup>superscript</sup> and the <sub>subscript</sub> tags. Today's dat eis the 16
            <sup>th</sup> of June 2019. Almost all living things on the Planet Earth breathe Oxygen, whose scientific formula is O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockquote_element"><p>In HTML and XHTML, the blockquote element defines "a section
            [winthin a document] that is quoted from another source."The blockquote element is used to uindicate the quotoation of large section of
            text from another source. Using the default HTML styling of most web browsers, it will indent the right and left margins both on the
            display and in the printed form, but this may be overridden by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</p></blockquote>

            <h2>The following paragraph is a demonstartion of the <df>cite, dfn, address, ins , del and s</df>tags.</h2>
            <p>The <dfn>cite tag</dfn> is used in HTMl and in webpages when you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film, or a reasearch
            paper. The cite tag is used to indicate where the citationis from. For instance, the details and information about the cite tag used in
            the above senentence is taken from <cite>HTML & CSS design and build websites</cite> by Jon Duckett.<br />
            The <dfn>dfn tag</dfn> is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term. The first time you explain some new terminology (perhaps
            an academic concept or some jargon) in a document, it is known as a defining instance of it.<br />
            The <dfn>address tag </dfn> is used for a specific purpose, to contain contact details for the author of the page. It can contain physical
            address, a phone number and an email id for instance. Browsers often dispaly the content of the address tag in italics. There is an additional
            resource in HTML called the <dfn>hCard microformat</dfn> for adding physical address information to the webpage. <br />
            The <dfn>ins, del, and s</dfn> are used to make emphasis on the content of the webpage. The <dfn>ins</dfn> tag can be used to show content
            that has been inserted into a document., while the <dfn>del</dfn> tag can show text that has been deleted from it. The content of an ins
            tag is usually <ins>underlined</ins>, while the content of a del tag usually <del>has a line through it</del>. For example, It was the
            <del>worst</del> <ins>best</ins> idea ever, in a million years. <br />
            The <dfn>s tag</dfn> indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted). Visually the content of an s
            tag will usually be displayed <s>with a line through the center</s>. For example, Laptop for Sale: <s>Was $3990</s> Now $1234.</p>
