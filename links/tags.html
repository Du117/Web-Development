        <h1>This is a Demonstration of HTML tags.</h1>
        <p>This is the paragraph tag. This tag would contain paragraphs containing information that are essential for the webpage.</p>
        <h2>Demonstration of the tags br and hr.</h2>
        <p>under normal circumstances the browser would collapse all extra whitespaces in between the html code. To overcome this we use the
        breakline tag. I am using a breakline tag here to demonstrate its use.<br />See how the content of restarts from the next line. The
        following line demostrate the use of the hr tag. <hr />See how there exists a horizontal line in between the above sentence and this 
        one.</p>
        <div>
            <p>This is a different division inside the HTML Body. The following is a demonstration of the "pre" tag.
            <hr />
            <pre>
                This is an example of the "pre" tag. It displays the content on the browser as it is written in the HTML Script.
                For instance how this sentence starts on a new line as is written in the HTML script.          And the amount of space left
                before this one.
            </pre><hr /></p>
        </div>
        <br /><br />
        <hr />
        <div>          <!--Demonstration of Text markuop tags : strong, b, em, i, code, del, sub, sup.-->
            <h2>Text Markup Tags - strong, b, em, i, code, del, sub and sup tags</h2>
            <p>This is the demonstration of the <strong>strong tag</strong>. This a demonstration of the "b" tag which is used to <b>make the 
            contents within the tags bold.</b><br />
            <em>This is an example of the use of the "em" tag.</em> The italics tag "i" converts the contents of the paragraph within the 
            <i>italics tag to italics</i>.<br/>
            The following is a demonstration of the "code" tag, which is used for displaying programming language codes in an HTML page.
            <code>
                <pre>
                #include[iostream.h]
                #inlcude[conio.h]
                using namespace std ;
                int main()
                {
                    printf("Hello World !!!")
                    return 0 ;
                }</pre>
            </code>
            This is a demonstration of the <del>deleted</del> tag.<br />
            The following is a demonstration of the <sup>superscript</sup> and the <sub>subscript</sub> tags. Today's dat eis the 16
            <sup>th</sup> of June 2019. Almost all living things on the Planet Earth breathe Oxygen, whose scientific formula is O<sub>2</sub>.
